                            Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed. It involves algorithms and statistical models that identify patterns and make decisions based on past experiences. Machine learning is classified into three main types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models, unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in data without labels, and reinforcement learning involves agents learning to make decisions through trial and error. Machine learning is widely used in applications such as natural language processing, image recognition, and predictive analytics.
